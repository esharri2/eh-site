Do you need another front-end development blog in your feed? Probably not. Are you better off just reading [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)? Probably. Is there already a [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) article about it? Yep.

Welcome to the blog anyway! I can't *really* make the case why we need another one, but I'll tell you why I'm doing it.

I want to share techniques and tips, mostly inspried by my day-to-day web development, for making websites that work better for all people. I appreciate technical writing that shows solutions to real-world problems, especially ones that appear frequently. Hopefully I can produce writing like this that you will find relevant and useful.

Thanks for reading.
