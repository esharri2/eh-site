Do you need another front-end development blog in your feed? Probably not. Are you better off just reading [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)? Probably. Is there already a [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) article about it? Yep.

Welcome to the blog anyway! I can't *really* make the case why we need another one, but I'll tell you why I'm doing it.

First, I want to share techniques and tips, mostly inspried by my day-to-day web development, for making websites that work better for all people. I appreciate technical writing that shows solutions to "real-world" problems, especially ones that appear frequently. Hopefully I can produce writing like this that you will find relevant and useful.

Second, teaching is a great way to learn. One challenging thing about doing front end developement is the need to
know about a lot of different browser and language features even if you rarely use them. For example, you (hopefully) aren't using [MutationObservers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) every day. But they can be *really* helpful in a pinch. I hope by documenting what I know I can help myself keep track of it all and ultimately deepen my understanding of the web. 

Thanks for reading.
