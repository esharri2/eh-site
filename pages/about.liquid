    <p>I am a web developer in Raleigh, North Carolina. I mostly work on big websites for big companies. But I also enjoy building small, impactful sites for people who are doing and making cool things. I try to develop sites and applications with a user-first mindset so that the final result is accessible, performant, pleasing, and powerful.</p>
